> I think there is a massive opportunity in writing software that will automate the selection (style, price, materials), production and delivery of tailored dresses.

If you want a [Grand Boubou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boubou_(clothing)) or any traditional dresses right now, here are the steps:

1. The customer checks out (gets recommendations from friends, family) about the hot trends (sometimes gets the tissues first).
2. Then he/she goes on to the tailor to discuss the specifications (price, style, delivery date).
3. Upon agreement the tailor takes the customer's measurements and provide recommendations on style.
4. The tailor makes the dress, customer pays and the transaction ends (a relationship is built for the future in the event of a good experience).

There are other stuff in between but this is the gist and general process. This is highly wasteful of both parties time and energy. The best medium (with the current state of technology) to incorporate all these steps in a seamless experience is in a smartphone app.

Here are the steps with the custom tailor app:

1. The tailors go ahead and uploads their killer designs, profile and materials (tissues, buttons and extras).
2. The customer downloads the app and is automatically prompted to take a picture of their entire body, then the app automatically spits out his/her measurements (neck, bust, waist, chest, bicep, hips, thigh…).
3. The customer browses the designs (already have the final price based on the customer's measurement, choice of style and preferences). 
4. The tailor makes the dress. The customer pays extra if they prefer a faster delivery date or shipping.

“Waouh effects”

Customer:
This app's "waouh effect" is the fact that it spits out the customer's accurate measurements in the first few seconds, and the fact that all decision parameters are present when viewing the dress. (customized view based on personal measurement and stylistic preferences.). Finally the user will enjoy a wide variety of designs, options and inspirations.

Tailor:
He or she would get instant access (more over time) of paying customers and all details to make the dress right (express his/her creativity). Also the tailor will never need to argue again "wahaale (negotiate prices)" or any of that non-sense, they will just focus on what they do best, making custom dresses that the customer will love. Finally, the best tailors will be able to get the best reviews, credentials and build their business for the long term.

Technical specifications:
This app (IOS and android)'s killer feature is the ability to get the user's accurate measurements, ability to compute final price based on all decision criteria and speed. The usual time between download to final checkout should less than 30 minutes.

The app will be able to scan and provide accurate measurements through machine learning. All computations will done in the cloud (AWS, Google cloud engine...). The algorithms will be heavily tested and trained during the beta phase.

Local environment: 
Dakar is one of the best places in the world to experiment and implement the first beta version as they are almost tailor shops at every street corner. The average citizen also cares deeply about tailored dresses (traditional and modern).

Scaling:
This company (app) will be really fast to scale. The target market on release will be the upper-class women in Dakar (almady, downtown ...). The penetration rate target will be about 15 to 30% in less than 6 weeks. Also it is worth to note that the company will not have to deal with any tangible things, the great experience is fully provided through software.

Long term: 

If this idea is successfully implemented in Dakar (Senegal), the next markets to take over, are the major West African cities. If we get to the ones in Nigeria and have more than 30% penetration, this company will be worth more than a billion dollars, after that the sky is the limit.

Grounded truths for the next 10, 20 years:

1. Customers will want their deliveries to be faster and faster.
2. Customers will want more and more exact (precise, accurate) measurements.
3. Customers will want better ways to see how a dress will look on them before purchase. (immersive experience)
4. Customers will want less and less time consuming process in choosing and getting their custom dresses.

Other implementations (in 5 - 10 years):
As virtual and augmented reality mature, their implementations will add on and give the best user experience possible.

> The general idea of custom dresses “tailoring” is not going away and would even grow as technology makes it easier and more appealing than manufactured clothes in the old fashioned way.
