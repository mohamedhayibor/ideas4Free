# Cultural Hacker Residences

Heard about the Whole Foods joke? => "Whole Paycheck"

In your 20s, you get to almost always think about the big elephant in the room, rent.

At a young age, you can figure out ways to drastically save money: on food and clothes. The one that is almost impossible get around is rent. If you've lived in Boston, New york, worse San Francisco, you know the pain.

Depending on what industry you're in, sometimes there is a strong need to be in those places, but more often than not, the necessities are only reliable High speed internet and electricity.

Imagine that there are these "Hacker Residences". Where you could stay for 3 months at only $1000 and get:

* a private room
* co-working space
* basic ameneties
* social lounge

At the very least, some young startups will flock to your residence. If it could also blend in with the local vibe/culture, even better, indie hackers would love it.

I could envision myself hopping every 3 month at a residence in Eastern Europe, South America, West Africa, Asia.

> This would blend in the best of both worlds, getting to travel and at the same time doing solid work for your startup, contract or freelancing while getting constantly inspired by new cultures, people and places.

## Why Now?

The Global forces are multiple: economic, political, artistic.

* economic: living in cities such as San Francisco has almost become unreasonable due to high rent and other living expenses
* technological: high speed wifi, drastic improvement in living conditions (in poor countries)
* cultural: rich local culture
* environment: beautiful weather

> The main risk: if target countries become more restrictive about visa issues.
