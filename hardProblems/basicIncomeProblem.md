# How could we implement basic income and make it a reality?

With the ever accelerating rate of technological progress. It is clear that some people will need a safety net as all manual and semi work will be automated. Some people are trying out the concept and others are frowning upon the idea as to somehow killing capitalism.

Let's hold off a minute maybe we have it wrong. Maybe we got the wrong framing here. What are the basics for any human being for the next 200 to 300 years. At the top of my head it is 3 things:

1. Food
2. Shelter
3. Connectivity (all things tech)

We can take advantage of the accelerating rate of technological innovation and make it crack how we could more abundance out of these 3 things. We don't need and more money or a social regime per se. Just abundance of food, shelter and connectivity and lets trust that with these 3 humans will be productive for even greater output and of course technological advancement.
