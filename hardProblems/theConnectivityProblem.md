The US is super advanced with connectivity but I am affraid that there is a big gap too wide to be close as big telelcom companies are munging on it and making big bucks.

It doesn't make sense that in the US, you have to pay your monthly wifi with comcast then pay more than $70.00 for your smartphone data plan. I believe that this is a $1000.00 dollars lost opportunity every year. The infrastructure 
is not even scalable as individuals will have multiple interconnected devices.

How about if we created a distributed system that automatically connects you to all closest wifi sources all the time.

> This is an ultimate possibility. For god sake, we have sattellites overhead, mesh networking, encryption for security and privacy. Single-threaded Node for efficient task handling, event-loops.... So on and so forth.

You wouldn't have to check the local wifi and try to connect (hunting out passwords) it will automatically connect you, give you a unique key for that entire session then destroy it at the end.

> For extra security, the data will be encrypted when it is going up to the satellites and then decrypted once it hits the client

> Encryption will be a big part of this.

> Connectivity is becoming as important as water.

And again the "spyder way" of connecting will be natural and the user wouldn't even have to think about it.
