Let's start with the freaking problem, it doesn't make sense that we are paying wifi at our home, work and caffes and also having to pay ATT or the other big fat cats $70 or more for a phone plan.

There's gotta be a way you could have wifi all the time without having to pay for a phone plan. The technology is already here with browser authentification and the abilityto re-route packets from the internet.

With *name of startup* any device that has a browser could access our wifi network which is basically a network of providers and users.

The way we are solving this problem is this:

1. The user will never have to give or receive a password to or from us.

> If they are signing up for our service they will be already using their personal wifi. We will get it directly from there and save an encrypted version of it in our database. If they are trying to connect into that wifi network, we will directly give them (already signed up for our service and terms) access and track the time of usage then bill them accordingly.

2. Security is a major part of our solution.

> The curve 25519 will be used to encrypt and decrypt the wifi-passwords and all of this is done away from the user. The user press a button and it works, all the heavywork is done on the backend.

3. User-friendlyness: users never have to think about wifi passwords again or having to pay the fat cats.

What's the market:
-----
Any device that can authentificate from a browser. Huge opportunity in the US as internet data plans for phones are super expensive.
