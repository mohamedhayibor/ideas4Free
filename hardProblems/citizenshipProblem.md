# How do we solve the stinking problem of citizenship and travel between countries?

The system is broken and a small amount of humans can travel anywhere they want. Some can't leave even their village.


###### Narrative




###### Potential solutions
- VR: for meettings, travel sight-seeing (still divided but digitally included)
- Central ( distributed in architechture) system for registering all humans in the world (Maybe get rid of all country flags, and create a world citizenship revolution)
