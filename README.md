# ideas4Free
Execution is everything. Cliche but true. Do whatever you want with them. :sunglasses:

# Why
I stall on ideas. So I have decided to open source all of them (totally free). It is more pressure on my end to implement things quickly because the world knows about it already. You might notice that some of them are not fully described, use your imagination and engineering genius to bend, morph and bring them to reality.

Also the term `App` here, can signify mobile, desktop apps (even VR, Iot, walls, neural devices ...). I intend on pushing as much as ideas as possible. Hopefully some of them would still potential after I die.


# ideas

#### 1. App that suggest words / expressions from a particular industry when writing (to sound smart)

> intended users: the upcoming professional in a specific industry (Finance, Law, Software...)

#### 2. App that prompts user to become a better interviewee (semantic of answers)

> intended users: any job seekers

#### 3. App that automatically fetch and downloads images from unsplash or any (creativecommons source) based on a set tags / criteria

> intended users: Designers, programmers building prototypes (...just about anybody)

#### 4. App that automatically notifies you when a relative puts something on their public Amazon wishlist (Amazon, Apple...)

> intended users: (Parents, old people... just about anybody)

#### 5. App that prompts user in asking better questions (emails, forums, social)

> intended users: (noobs in a field,... just about anybody)

#### 6. App that visualize all dependencies of a repository. Or better create app that can import a repos and help the user in understanding what the source code does and the design patterns in them.

> intended users: noobs in programming, anyone writting software for fun or work

#### 7. App that visualize any hard or foreign concepts (ie: neural networks, algorithms, ai concepts...)

> intended users: any learner of a particular field

#### 8. App that helps user make better decisions (considering optionality, value, cost/benefit, compounding )

> intended users: just about anybody

#### 10. Browser that incrementally adds more content (or close) from a page based on user's intent and level of interest. (First shows summary then shows more with more interest from user)

> intended users: anybody that wants to have a better web experience and less B.S.

#### 11. App that helps user prioritize between tasks (figures the most important ones by wieghting impact, compounding ...)

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 12. App or device that analyze user's brain waves and auto plays piece of music that has the highest probability of triggering peak state (auto-tunes volume as well).

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 13. watch that lights up (range of red and green) the probability of a bike accident when crossing against red lights. (perhaps will integrate the driveless car technology to analyze traffic before every cross light)

> intended users: For bike rides in the habit of crossing red lights.

#### 14. Underwear or suit that converts heat into power for small devices (phones, iot and other devices...)

> intended users: For Go Green individuals, energy poor environments

#### 15. Head device that writes out your thoughts (text, word format) and saves in a private cloud. + The ability the snippets by thoughts. (maybe the neural lace buzz will make it happen)

> intended users: just about anybody

#### 16. App that drills down user on questions (why, hows...) for him or her to get clarity of intent and be able to make better decisions.

> intended users: For individuals making critical decisions on a daily basis.

#### 17. Head device (or even pill) that filters out toxins from our brains so that we don't get the need to go to sleep.

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 18. Pill that provides all essential nutrients for the brain so people could fast for 3 / 4 day or a week and still get high cognitive performance.  

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 19. Device that block out outside noise or hyper tunes them for super low noise (not hearable to humans) automatically (triggered by thoughts or brain waves)

> intended users: individuals who avoid distractions at all cost

#### 20. Pill that eliminate sexual desires when the user is on a high concentration (focus) mode.

> intended users: High performing individuals

# Final thought
I will be more than happy if you implement any of them and make billions or just for fun.
