# ideas4Free
Execution is everything. Cliche but true. Do whatever you want with them. :sunglasses:

# Why
I stall on ideas. So I have decided to open source all of them (totally free). It is more pressure on my end to implement things quickly because the world knows about it already. You might notice that some of them are not fully described, use your imagination and engineering genius to bend, morph and bring them to reality.

Also the term `App` here, can signify mobile, desktop apps (even VR, Iot, walls, neural devices ...). I intend on pushing as much as ideas as possible. Hopefully some of them would still have potential after I die.


# ideas

#### 1. App that suggest words / expressions from a particular industry when writing (to sound smart)

#### 2. App that prompts user to become a better interviewee (semantic of answers)

#### 3. App that automatically fetch and downloads images from unsplash or any (creativecommons source) based on a set tags / criteria

#### 4. App that automatically notifies you when a relative puts something on their public Amazon wishlist (Amazon, Apple...)

#### 5. App that prompts user in asking better questions (emails, forums, social)

#### 6. App that visualize all dependencies of a repository. Or better create app that can import a repos and help the user in understanding what the source code does and the design patterns in them.

#### 7. App that visualize any hard or foreign concepts (ie: neural networks, algorithms, ai concepts...)

#### 8. App that helps user make better decisions (considering optionality, value, cost/benefit, compounding )

#### 10. Browser that incrementally adds more content (or close) from a page based on user's intent and level of interest. (First shows summary then shows more with more interest from user)

#### 11. App that helps user prioritize between tasks (figures the most important ones by wieghting impact, compounding ...)

#### 12. App or device that analyze user's brain waves and auto plays piece of music that has the highest probability of triggering peak state (auto-tunes volume as well).

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 13. watch that lights up (range of red and green) the probability of a bike accident when crossing against red lights. (perhaps will integrate the driveless car technology to analyze traffic before every cross light)

#### 14. Underwear or suit that converts heat into power for small devices (phones, iot and other devices...)

#### 15. Head device that writes out your thoughts (text, word format) and saves in a private cloud. + The ability to access the snippets by thoughts. (maybe the neural lace buzz will make it happen)

#### 16. App that drills down user on questions (why, hows...) for him or her to get clarity of intent and be able to make better decisions.

#### 17. Head device (or even pill) that filters out toxins from our brains so that we don't get the need to go to sleep.

#### 18. Pill that provides all essential nutrients for the brain so people could fast for 3 / 4 day or a week and still get high cognitive performance.  

> intended users: High performing individuals

#### 19. Device that block out outside noise or hyper tunes them for super low noise (not hearable to humans) automatically (triggered by thoughts or brain waves)

#### 20. Pill that eliminate sexual desires when the user is on a high concentration (focus) mode.

#### 21. Create device that downloads someone's entire memory (with possibility to strip out the bad parts). If we figure out how to install into another person's brain even better. We would save individuals hours of toiling to learn subject already studied and well understood by humans. (Huge saving in time)


#### 22. Create a device that gets installed in the brain that will serve as identification. (no remembering password, visas, passport, or ids) - see: (hardProblems/citizenshipProblem)


#### 23. Build an island that fully implements a distributed system in whatever global decisions (computer aided weighting system):  design, food, buildings, global agenda ... (better version of capitalism and democracy combined, avoid any type of socialism we experienced in the past)


#### 24. Build a Hologram technology that can be projected into any surface (watch, walls, table, anywhere) "VR without wearing a mask"

#### 25. Software technology that continuously goes through all open source projects for automated testing (bugs, security vulnerabilities - no need for writing manual tests anymore)

#### 26. Device or technology that gets rid of natural ovulation (The male and female will provide respective bank of spermatozoids and ovules > only the best cells will be matched and feconded with - no more infants with disabilities - healthier humans - 100x improvements)

#### 27. Create technology that can bear an egg all the way to maturation (whole 9 months - gain of productivity for all females)

#### 28. Create alternatives to sexual intercourse (device that will activate appropriate parts of the brain for that need - no more STDs or AIDS after a generation)

#### 29. technology that sucks out all nutrients out of every ounce of a dead body for better agriculture or transmutation in energy.

#### 30. Create an alternate shower technology: instead of wasting of gallons of water, high pressurized humid air will be used. (gain of productivity as well: will potentially last for 30 seconds)

#### 31. Create technology that can transfer one's consciousness to younger clones. (bodies will be just vehicles)

#### 32. Create a technology that can accelerate our brain thinking (ie: increasing its clock time)

#### 33. Create a technology that makes the brain more Non-blocking IO: When humans waste a lot of time worrying some BS (what the people at the coffee shop think of us, ....). In brief we are pretty bad at thinking straight when we are in fear, stressed, upset. The technology will make us no get "blocked" on those negative moments.

#### 34. Create a device that automatically sends all our slow thinking (complex computations) to a computer. We will get to maximize our fast thinking potential.

#### 35. Create technology that allow any humans to connect to any public camera or drone (extreme bird view...) and see as what the device can capture. (We already have the tech to make it a reality, maybe we will just spend more time designing the distributed system algorithms)

#### 36. Make the brain more powerful and making it consume more % energy away from the other parts. (Could move more towards bionic arms, legs)

#### 37. Technology that forces to zoom in and out of focus in order to solve hard problems. (Will systematically make think at lower or higher level of abstractions - maybe cut the time required to solve a problem by a factor of 10)

#### 38. Create a thought simulation (provocation) machine so that people don't have to take drugs to deal with nasty things such as depression, stress, anger, insecurities.

#### 39. Technology that could effectively freeze the body when we are sleeping. (Maybe give us younger bodies - ability to live longer)

#### 40. Create software that could compute shortest paths (Traveling Salesman Problem) the most efficiently for 3d directions. ie: traffic, cruise control of drones, shared flying cars (cabs), and other flying vehicles.

#### 41. Create a distributed system (thinking as one mind) that will monitor all agriculture plants live at matter of minutes providing water, nutrients when necessary. What's the big vision here?

> We could have a system that monitors the aggregate data the live data of what people are buying and shaping production of food and other products accordingly. (Balancing supply and demand at matters of seconds - milliseconds)

#### 42. Create submarine propellers for Island, floating cities and other energy poor environments.

#### 43. Create a software that could transpile any source code (any language) into a common language (JS, Python...)

#### 44. Create technology that gets rid of all possible wires. (doable with current tech)

#### 45. Create technology that could transfer one's consciousness to any other cyborg (computer, machine) to any parts of the world or planets as long as we have connectivity. (The faster we could transfer data, the faster we could travel)

#### 46. Create technology that processes all images from satellites for key metrics such as rain, transportation...

#### 47. Create technology that could minimize doubts (Less wasted time - dabbling around)

#### 48. Create composable apartments into flexible buildings.

#### 49. Create drug that could keep us awake for a week.

#### 50. 3d printer that prints your everyday items (clothes, shoes, phone, watch, hats...). Designers might sell unique designs (economies of scale).

#### 51. Create a platform for cross-disciplinary crash courses. In this era, people will be switching from different domains at least 4. An example would a software engineer wanting to transition to electrical engineer to get a leverage from both field to build something. The crash courses could be designed in a way that they could be done in a week. "Learning designed for adults"

#### 52. Create the ultimate compiler that will build for any platform (ios, android, mac, linux, windows...), no need for sdks ever again.


# Final thought
I will be more than happy if you implement any of them and make billions or just for fun.
