Execution is everything. Cliche but true. Do whatever you want with them. :sunglasses:

# Why
I stall on ideas. So I have decided to open source all of them (totally free). It is more pressure on my end to implement things quickly because the world knows about it already. You might notice that some of them are not fully described, use your imagination and engineering genius to bend, morph and bring them to reality.

Also the term `App` here, can signify mobile, desktop apps (even VR, Iot, walls, neural devices ...). I intend on pushing as much as ideas as possible. Hopefully some of them would still potential after I die.


# ideas

#### 1. App that suggest words / expressions from a particular industry when writing (to sound smart)

> intended users: the upcoming professional in a specific industry (Finance, Law, Software...)

#### 2. App that prompts user to become a better interviewee (semantic of answers)

> intended users: any job seekers

#### 3. App that automatically fetch and downloads images from unsplash or any (creativecommons source) based on a set tags / criteria

> intended users: Designers, programmers building prototypes (...just about anybody)

#### 4. App that automatically notifies you when a relative puts something on their public Amazon wishlist (Amazon, Apple...)

> intended users: (Parents, old people... just about anybody)

#### 5. App that prompts user in asking better questions (emails, forums, social)

> intended users: (noobs in a field,... just about anybody)

#### 6. App that visualize all dependencies of a repository. Or better create app that can import a repos and help the user in understanding what the source code does and the design patterns in them.

> intended users: noobs in programming, anyone writting software for fun or work

#### 7. App that visualize any hard or foreign concepts (ie: neural networks, algorithms, ai concepts...)

> intended users: any learner of a particular field

#### 8. App that helps user make better decisions (considering optionality, value, cost/benefit, compounding )

> intended users: just about anybody

#### 10. Browser that incrementally adds more content (or close) from a page based on user's intent and level of interest. (First shows summary then shows more with more interest from user)

> intended users: anybody that wants to have a better web experience and less B.S.

#### Final thought
I will be more than happy if you implement any of them and make billions or just for fun.
